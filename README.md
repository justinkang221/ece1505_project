# Project for ECE1505

This code was developed for ECE1505 (Convex Optimization). We compare different ways to perform sparse channel estimation. In particular, we compare off-grid and grid-based compressive sensing.

## Requirements

In order to run this code, you must install the following libraries;
1. ASP[https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mpf/asp/]
2. CVX[http://cvxr.com/cvx/]


## Report

To view a report of our findings please see [https://www.overleaf.com/read/vddscgnmhzxg]

## Figures
For the performance comparison figure (i.e., NMSE vs SNR), run chl_est_hybrid.m

For gridpoints comparison figure (NMSE vs. G_b) run chl_est_hybrid_grid_vs_gridpoints.m
